## Overview

In the project, we develop a pressure-sensing textile interface that learns unique typing patterns through a convolutional neural network (CNN). By training the CNN on a calibration sequence of key presses, we enable next-character prediction tailored to individual users. We enhance this model with a language model for contextual guidance, improving accuracy, and apply fine-grained and channel pruning to optimize inference latency for real-time use. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight, intelligent typing models for novel edge devices, paving the way for more adaptive and versatile input interfaces.
