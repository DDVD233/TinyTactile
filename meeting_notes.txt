  - Compare classifiers using different tokens?
  - Demo
    - Maybe have a live inference situation
      - Streamed using bluetooth
    - Backup video
  - Perhaps would be helpfun to split version of training file
  - Data processing
    - Min of each frame
    - Try other different strategies
  - Possible model
    - Min heatmap -> 2D CNN -> Flatten -> Classifier
  - Quantization
    - Pressure map - black or white
    - Maybe more fine-grained for letters close to each others
  - User calibration
    - Method depends on tokenization
    - Finetuning updates a heatmap to be non-biased towards QWERTY
  - Training approach
    - Sequence of temporal frames or individual frame
    - Individual frame easier perhaps
  - We need to think about how portray how this project is "Tiny"
    - Quantize inputs and outputs
    - What's the story? Compare latency and MACs
  - Architecture model
    - Frontend with prompts, text input, and buttons
      - Button to switch between mode (live and calibrate) 
      - Will probably do React frontend
  - Mat has support for custom method
    - Perhaps can start the backend
    - Can pass array of pressure values

  - Deliverables for next meeting
    - Gary
      - React/Flask app
      - Make a fake model for Devin to interface with
    - Devin
      - Data recording for modifier and punctuation keys
      - Split everything into individual files
    - David - First crack at model
